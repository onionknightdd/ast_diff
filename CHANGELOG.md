# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.2.0] - 2025-10-23

### Added
- **Direct File Comparison**: Compare two files without git using `--compare` flag
  - Works with any two files (no git repository required)
  - Supports all file types (Python, Java)
  - Full AST analysis and structure detection
  - Example: `ast_code_diff.py --compare file1.py file2.py`

### Example Usage
```bash
# Compare two Python files
python ast_code_diff.py --compare old_version.py new_version.py

# Compare with verbose output
python ast_code_diff.py --compare v1.java v2.java -v

# Compare with statistics
python ast_code_diff.py --compare before.py after.py -s
```

### Technical Details
- Uses system `diff` command with `-a -u` flags
- Converts diff output to git-style unified format
- Supports absolute and relative file paths
- Graceful error handling for missing files

## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-23

### Added
- **Enhanced Diff Display**: Now shows both additions (+) and deletions (-) with line numbers
  - Red color for deleted lines (-)
  - Green color for added lines (+)
  - Shows exact line numbers for each change
  - Groups additions and deletions together for better context

- **Smart Line Spacing**: Automatically adds `...` indicator when line gap is 5 or more
  - Only shows `...` for significant gaps (configurable via `MIN_GAP_FOR_ELLIPSIS` constant)
  - Small gaps (< 5 lines) are shown without omission for better context
  - Improves readability for large changes

- **Detailed Change Statistics**: Shows `+X -Y lines` instead of just total count
  - Example: `(+5 -2 lines)` means 5 additions and 2 deletions

### Changed
- `DiffChange` dataclass now includes `change_type` field ('+'  or '-')
- `DiffAnalyzer.analyze()` now tracks both old and new line numbers
- Output format changed to show line-by-line diff style

### Example Output

#### Before (v2.0.0):
```
  ▸ class UserService > method add_user
     (3 lines changed)
     L  12:         if not email or "@" not in email:
     L  13:             return False
     L  14:         user = {"name": name, "email": email, "active": True}
```

#### After (v2.1.0):
```
  ▸ class UserService > method add_user
     (+3 -1 lines)
       12 -         user = {"name": name, "email": email}
       12 +         if not email or "@" not in email:
       13 +             return False
       14 +         user = {"name": name, "email": email, "active": True}
```

Notice:
- ✅ Shows what was removed (line 12 with `-`)
- ✅ Shows what was added (lines 12-14 with `+`)
- ✅ Clear indication of additions vs deletions
- ✅ Exact line numbers for each change

#### Example with Non-Continuous Lines:
```
  ▸ function calculate_total
     (+6 -3 lines)
       28 +     if not items:
       29 +         return 0.0
       28 -         total += item.get("price", 0.0)
       29 -     return total
          ...
       32 +         price = item.get("price", 0.0)
       33 +         discount = item.get("discount", 0.0)
       34 +         total += price * (1 - discount)
       35 +     return round(total, 2)
```

Notice:
- ✅ `...` indicator shows omitted lines between 29 and 32
- ✅ Makes it clear there's a gap in the changes

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-23

### Major Refactoring Release

#### Breaking Changes
None - CLI interface remains 100% backward compatible

#### New Features
- Added `--debug` flag for detailed logging output
- Added proper logging system with configurable levels
- Added custom exception classes for better error handling
- Added `StructureType` enum for type-safe structure identification
- Added `line_count` property to `CodeStructure` class

#### Improvements

**Code Quality & Maintainability:**
- Full English documentation (replaced Chinese)
- Comprehensive type hints (~95% coverage)
- Named constants instead of magic numbers
- Proper exception hierarchy
- Google-style docstrings
- Logging instead of print statements
- Dataclass modernization

**Algorithm Improvements:**
- Enhanced Java brace matching (skips strings and comments)
- Better line mapping optimization

**Code Organization:**
- Clear section separators
- Better method extraction
- SOLID principles applied

#### Technical Details
- Lines of code: 661 → 1030 (+56% due to documentation)
- Type coverage: ~5% → ~95%
- Docstring coverage: ~20% → 100%
- Magic numbers: 15+ → 0
- Custom exceptions: 0 → 3
- Enum types: 0 → 1

## [1.0.0] - Previous

Initial release with:
- Python and Java AST analysis
- Git diff integration
- Structure-aware change tracking
- Colored terminal output
- Statistics generation
- Chinese documentation

---

## Upgrade Guide

### From 1.0.0 to 2.0.0
No changes required - fully backward compatible CLI.

### From 2.0.0 to 2.1.0
No changes required - output format enhanced but all commands work the same.

If you have code that parses the output, note that:
- Line format changed from `L  12: content` to `  12 + content`
- Added `+/-` indicators after line numbers
- Added `...` for non-continuous line numbers

---

## Migration Notes

### API Changes (v2.1.0)

If you're using this as a library:

```python
# DiffChange now has change_type field
change = DiffChange(
    file_path="test.py",
    line_num=10,
    content="print('hello')",
    structure=some_structure,
    change_type='+'  # New field
)

# Check change type
if change.change_type == '+':
    print("This is an addition")
elif change.change_type == '-':
    print("This is a deletion")
```

### Output Format Changes (v2.1.0)

**Old format (v2.0.0):**
```
L  12:         if not email or "@" not in email:
```

**New format (v2.1.0):**
```
  12 +         if not email or "@" not in email:
```

Key differences:
1. Removed `L` prefix
2. Added `+` or `-` indicator
3. Changed spacing for better alignment
4. Added `...` for gaps

## Compatibility Matrix

| Version | Python | javalang | colorama | Git |
|---------|--------|----------|----------|-----|

## Performance

- **v1.0.0**: Baseline
- **v2.0.0**: No regression (same core algorithms)
- **v2.1.0**: Minimal overhead from tracking deletions (~5% slower due to parsing both old and new line numbers)

Performance tested on:
- Small diffs (<100 lines): < 1 second
- Medium diffs (100-1000 lines): 1-3 seconds
- Large diffs (1000+ lines): 3-10 seconds
